 * still edited separately, and readme.txt's Stable tag is the one WordPress.org
 * actually serves — a release where it disagrees with the header ships a
 * version nobody is offered as an update, and fixing it means another release.
 *
 * The deploy workflow checks the same four against the git tag, which is the
 * one thing this file cannot see.
